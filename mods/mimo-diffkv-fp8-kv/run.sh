# MiMo-V2 fp8 KV cache enablement mod.
#
# Two upstream gaps (verified against vllm main 2026-09-22):
# 1. mimo_v2.py never passes cache_config to Attention(), so Attention()
#    resolves kv_cache_dtype to "auto" and --kv-cache-dtype fp8 is silently
#    ignored on all 48 target layers. Passing it has a trap: Attention() then
#    falls back to cache_config.sliding_window (128) for layers without a
#    per-layer window, so the full-attention layers get a copy with the window
#    cleared. Without that, long generations loop once the context passes the
#    window (reproduced 2026-09-23 at TP=2 and PP=3).
# 2. triton_attn_diffkv.py — the backend sm_121 selects for the 192/128 K/V
#    head dims — rejects quantized KV outright and does not view the cache as
#    fp8 on read.
#
# Same fix as tonyd2wild/MiMo-V2.6-Flash-2x-DGX-Spark patches 01+03, verified
# on GB10 (fp8 KV pool measured at 12.6 GiB, needle tests at 250K). Unlike his
# patch, non-e4m3 quantized caches stay rejected: the fp8 view would corrupt
# them. Each file is patched independently and skipped when already fixed
# (assumptions.md).
